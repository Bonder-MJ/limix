Limix is a flexible and efficient linear mixed model library with interfaces
to Python.
Genomic analyses require flexible models that can be adapted to the needs of
the user.
Limix is smart about how particular models are fitted to save
computational cost.

LATEST: [iSet, interaction set tests for gene-context interactions, is now in Limix.](https://github.com/PMBio/limix-tutorials/tree/master/iSet)
